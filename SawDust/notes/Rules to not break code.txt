1.	When wanting to change a code on an object, duplicate the object, tag your name either in
	the object's name or as a tag in Whitespace.
	e.g. You want to edit Obj_Coin. You duplicate that object and turn it into Obj_"Name"Coin.
	
2.	If help is needed, in the HELP!!! notes, write down the object, the event, and the line of the 
	code and provide an explaination for what you are trying to accomplish.
	e.g. Obj_Coin. Draw_Gui. Line 37. Can't draw text array.
